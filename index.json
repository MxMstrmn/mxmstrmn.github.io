I am interested in generative models, in particular for graph-structued data, and their application to the sciences, mostly in the domain of single-cell genomics and drug discovery, i.e. small molecules or proteins.\nPrior to my PhD, I have interned at the Bosch Center for AI and worked on explanation methods in computer vision and co-authored the paper ‚ÄúInterpretable and fine-grained visual explanations for convolutional neural networks‚Äù.\nIn addition to my academic pursuits, I am passionate about addressing the societal dimensions of AI. I have co-authored the book ‚ÄúWie Machinen lernen‚Äù to make machine learning accessible to a wide audience and actively engage in teaching computer science to both elementary and high school students through initiatives like ‚ÄúKI macht Schule‚Äù. I firmly believe in the importance of introducing young learners to contemporary computer science topics from an early age.\nBefore I forget: To be anonymous, go generic. In the English language, ‚ÄúJohn Doe‚Äù is about as generic as it gets. Now, as I am German I considered the pendant ‚ÄúMax Musterman‚Äù. Strip away the vowels and you have it: MxMstrmn.\n","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Hi üëã I pusue my doctoral studies as part of MUDS programme at the Computational Health Center at Helmholtz Munich and the Technical University Munich (TUM), supervised by Fabian Theis and Stephan G√ºnnemann.","tags":null,"title":"Leon Hetzel","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Leon Hetzel","Johanna Sommer","Bastian Rieck","Fabian Theis","Stephan G√ºnnemann"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"c344ba67d31c19577e3cd1b0a91e12dc","permalink":"https://mxmstrmn.github.io/publication/magnet/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/magnet/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce MAGNet, a novel graph-based model for molecule generation that uses abstract shapes before generating atom and bond types, addressing limitations in existing methods and creating molecules with more diverse topological structures and atom/bond assignments.","tags":[],"title":"MAGNet: Motif-Agnostic Generation of Molecules from Shapes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Lotfollahi","Anna Klimovskaia Susmelj","Carlo De Donno","Leon Hetzel","Yuge Ji","Ignacio L Ibarra","Sanjay R Srivatsan","Mohsen Naghipourfar","Riza M Daza","Beth Martin","Jay Shendure","Jose L McFaline‚ÄêFigueroa","Pierre Boyeau","F Alexander Wolf","Nafissa Yakubova","Stephan G√ºnnemann","Cole Trapnell","David Lopez‚ÄêPaz","Fabian J Theis"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682899200,"objectID":"a83debb7e3c944a6f51fdaa243e2991b","permalink":"https://mxmstrmn.github.io/publication/cpa/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cpa/","section":"publication","summary":"The compositional perturbation autoencoder (CPA) is a deep learning model for predicting the transcriptomic responses of single cells to single or combinatorial treatments from drugs and genetic manipulations.","tags":[],"title":"Predicting cellular responses to complex perturbations in high‚Äêthroughput screens","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johanna Sommer","Leon Hetzel","David L√ºdke","Fabian Theis","Stephan G√ºnnemann"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1680307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680307200,"objectID":"3a09386d12e4157f5a40f56ca5ca19f7","permalink":"https://mxmstrmn.github.io/publication/power_of_motifs/","publishdate":"2023-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/power_of_motifs/","section":"publication","summary":"We explore the impact of subgraph structures and vocabulary design on distribution learning for small drug molecules, aditionally, introducing a new method \"Subcover\" which improves upon existing approaches.","tags":[],"title":"The power of motifs as inductive bias for learning molecular distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leon Hetzel","Simon B√∂hm","Niki Kilbertus","Stephan G√ºnnemann","Mohammad Lotfollahi","Fabian Theis"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"6e3087d1c82cc7ffb59a70a3d0f8475a","permalink":"https://mxmstrmn.github.io/publication/chemcpa/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chemcpa/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a model which enables counterfactual response predictions for unseen drugs and evaluate how large scale bulk RNA-seq datasets can be leveraged to improve generalisation performance on single-cell data.","tags":[],"title":"Predicting Cellular Responses to Novel Drug Perturbations at a Single-Cell Resolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leon Hetzel","David Fischer","Stephan G√ºnnemann","Fabian Theis"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"db362edd97a186f6915b43a71665f9f0","permalink":"https://mxmstrmn.github.io/publication/graph_review/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/graph_review/","section":"publication","summary":"Graphs capture many phenomena in single-cell genomics, ranging from similarity and proximity of cells to gene networks.
